# Myge Game

### What is it?
Myge Game is a game where you play as a mage. As a mage you can have up to 4 spells;
you learn spells by defeating other mages.

Spell names and stats are randomly generated.

Kill or be killed, it is the way of the mage.

### Why?
This is my first "real" project in Lua and I want to create something I feel I can be proud of making, as well as something that I can realistically finish.

### Goals for Version 1.0
- Start as one generic mage (mage types for next iteration)
- Start with 4 spells
- See various stats about your run (health, level, run time, etc...)
- run into a variation of enemies (I'm thinking 3-4, more in next interation(s))
